<h2>CS1011a Project Three : Guessing Game</h2>
<h3>Computer Gaming with JavaScript</h3>
<hr/>
<p>This is an HTML webpage that has JavaScript embedded inside.<br/> This will allow the user to play a simple game.</p>
<p>The computer will think of a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)<br/> and the user will try to guess that number.<br/>The user can quit the game at any time by simply selecting the &lt;Cancel&gt; button.</p>
