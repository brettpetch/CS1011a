                    <p>This video was created to justify the spending of a TLLP experiment. This experiment included using various technologies in the classroom environment to get more positive engagement from students, as well as the attempt of using wobble stools for the more active students in teh class to retain focus.</p>
                    <p>Run by Mrs. Joanne Bridgeman-Sparks and Ms. Amy James-Popowich, this project was seen as insightful, and has been played at various conferences both locally and internationally.</p>
